                                class. Our daily learning outcomes help parents track their child’s development and
                                celebrate their achievements along the way. We’ve structured the learning for each age
                                group to ensure that every class builds on the previous one, guaranteeing continuous
                                growth and development.

                                always know what their child will be learning. Additionally, parents can easily track
                                their child’s progress through their personalized dashboard.

                                By the end of the course, students will not only understand how things work but will
                                also have developed the skills and confidence to bring their own mechanical creations to
                                life. Our hands-on, interactive approach ensures that each student, regardless of age or
                                experience level, leaves with a strong foundation in mechanics, ready for future STEM
